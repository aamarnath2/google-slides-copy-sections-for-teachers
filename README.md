# google-slides-copy-sections-for-teachers

Created a simple Python script to help a teacher separate a large Google Slides presentaiton that contained assignments for students. Separated the Google Slides presentation into several smaller copies that only contained some slides from the original. The script leverages the Google Drive API and Google Slides API.
